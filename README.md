# [Get To My Car](https://www.whereismycar.link/)

is a little utility app that helps you find your parked car.  
It all started because I'm tired of remembering where I parked my car.  
Hope it helps you too!

## Features

- Detect which floor you are on, and save where you parked your car.
- Record how long your car has been parked.
